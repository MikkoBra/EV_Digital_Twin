EV Sensors Dataset: Driving Pattern Diagnostics (2020-24)

📊 Overview
This dataset contains detailed hourly electric vehicle (EV) telemetry data collected from four unique EVs driven under distinct usage profiles: Rare User, Moderate User, Heavy User, and Regular User. The goal of the collection was to analyse driving patterns, detect early warning signs of system faults, and forecast upcoming Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) using sensor-based historical data.

Each dataset spans from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024, with hourly resolution, amounting to 43,200 time-stamped entries per vehicle.

📁 Files Included
rare_user.csv
moderate_user.csv
heavy_user.csv
regular_user.csv
Each file corresponds to a different user type, based on real-world EV usage patterns observed over a 5-year period. The driving profiles reflect usage intensity, charging behavior, and environmental stress levels on the vehicle.

🧪 Data Fields (Columns)

Column Name Description

Date and Time Timestamp of reading (format: DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
SOC State of Charge (%)
SOH State of Health (%)
Charging_Cycles Total number of full charging cycles completed
Battery_Temp Battery temperature in °C
Motor_RPM Motor revolutions per minute
Motor_Torque Torque generated by motor (Nm)
Motor_Temp Motor temperature in °C
Brake_Pad_Wear Brake pad wear percentage

Tire_Pressure Tire pressure in PSI
DTC Diagnostic Trouble Code recorded at the timestamp (if any)

👤 User Profile Breakdown
Rare User: Very light usage, occasional city trips, minimal stress on components.
Moderate User: Balanced daily commuting and occasional long drives.
Heavy User: High usage intensity including commercial or inter-city driving.
Regular User: Average driving pattern across urban and semi-urban areas.

🧠 Intended Use Cases

This dataset is ideal for:
Multivariate time-series forecasting (e.g., CNN + LSTM models)
Predictive maintenance modeling
DTC forecasting and anomaly detection
Sensor behavior under varied usage loads
EV health and usage simulation
